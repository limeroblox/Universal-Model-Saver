# Universal-Model-Saver
A script that saves models into rbxmx or rbxm, doesn’t really matter though.

## LIST OF SAVING TYPES
- Normal, decomps the model then saves it to the folder as a rbxm/rbxmx
- (In Webhook Saving Tab) Upload through webhook after saving (Experimental & You need your webhook url id)
- (In Test Tab) Same as normal but it decomps the local player's avatar to ensure the functions work as inteneded

## SETTINGS

- Script Decompilation, ONLY SAVES LOCAL SCRIPTS AND MODULE SCRIPTS, FILTERING ENABLED BASIC SCRIPTS CANNOT BE SAVED.
- Modes, with these features;
  - Normal mode; Basic Model Saving
  - Nightbound mode; Saves a selected nightbound, with the saving types included. This is for blackout revival zombies game mode.
